# Chat-Messenger-using-TCP-
This is an implementation of a simple “Chat Messenger” that is connection oriented (i.e. it uses TCP) and  that consists of a Client and a Server Program.  1) The Server runs first and waits for some client to contact it. 2) Client Program starts and connects to the server. 3) Client-Server sends and receives messages.  The UI of this project is made using tkinter.
